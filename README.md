# Troll Face ASCII Display Tool

## Overview

This Python script is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that displays an ASCII art representation of a troll face. When the user tries to close the main window, instead of closing, the application responds with a humorous behavior. It opens two additional windows, each displaying the troll face at random positions on the screen. This prank-like behavior will continue as long as the user keeps attempting to close the windows.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python and the `tkinter` library installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and follow the installation instructions.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
5. Run the script using a Python interpreter with the following command: `python WeDoALittleTrolling.py`

The application window will open, displaying the ASCII troll face.

## Fun Behavior

The main feature of this application is its playful behavior when attempting to close the main window. As mentioned earlier, instead of closing, the application will create two more windows, each displaying the troll face at random positions on the screen. The user can keep closing the windows manually, but the application will continue to spawn more windows in response, creating a fun and amusing experience.

## Notes

- This tool is intended for fun and demonstration purposes only. It's a harmless prank that can bring a smile to the user's face.
- Use this tool responsibly and with consent from other users if you choose to run it on their machines.
- The random positions of the additional windows make it more surprising and entertaining.
